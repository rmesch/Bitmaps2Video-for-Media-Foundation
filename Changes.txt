Fixed the root of all video-stuttering and timing issues. Hardware-encoding got faster. No more need to alter the timer-resolution or to put sleeps all over the code. Parameter EncodePriority no longer necessary.

Added option to encode audio to FLAC besides AAC.

Audio-synching is optimal if the audio-input comes from a .wav-file. You can use the utility uTransformer.SaveAudioStreamAsWav to transform an audio-file or the 1st audio-stream of a video-file to a wav-file before initializing encoding. To try this out in the demo some checkboxes have been added.

Some rework of writing the audio stream. Streams always start at time 0, by padding with silence. 2 new framerates to optimize synching to audio.

Added a hidden tab "Analysis" to the demo for displaying info about the frame-timing in the output-video. Requires the ffmeg-tool ffprobe.exe, info for download is displayed once you enable the tab.

Fixed some bugs occurring under Delphi XE7/8

Update to MFPack for SDK version 10.0.26100.0

Changes to uDirectoryTree.pas, uDemoWMFMain.pas, uBitmaps2VideoWMF.pas, uScaleWMF.pas to enable compatibility with Delphi XE7 and up, as proposed by Tony Kalf from FactoryXCode.
Hope I didn't mess it up again. I test on Delphi 12.1 CE.

Fixes to avoid stuttering video, by further slowing down frame generation. The slowdown is controlled by a new parameter EncodePriority passed to TBitmapEncoderWMF.Initialize. Precisely timed sleeps are inserted at some well chosen (?) spots. For this the timer-precision is set to 1 ms in uBitmapsToVideoWMF.pas initialization, and reset in finalization. 
Remark: in Windows 11 and later versions of Windows 10 this change is no longer system-wide.

Added advanced options to turn on/off some Mediafoundation attributes. I changed the default GOP-size, for example, which improves things.

A new look of the slideshow-part of the demo, inspired by the adaptation SinkWriterToEncodeVideoSample\Example3 of my project at https://github.com/FactoryXCode/MfPack

The repo no longer contains dproj-files. Before using the demo-project you should set the output directories to .\$(Platform)\$(Config) in the project options.

Replaced TVirtualImageList by TImagelist, hopefully now compiles with Seattle.

Rework of audio input. 
Fixed memory leaks (please report if memory consumption still keeps increasing).
Those leaks could not be detected by the Delphi memory manager. Could be they occurred in the graphics-driver, could be
one of the MF-Dlls is leaky. Fixed by reading up on Stackoverflow and by trial and error.
Tackled audio-sync issues on playback on devices not controlled by Windows. Mostly fixed (famous last words).

Video clips can now be inserted into the stream of bitmaps to be encoded to the video stream. 
New methods CrossfadeTo and ZoomInOutTransitionTo, they do the transition from the last added frame to the target.
Utility procedures GetVideoInfo and GetFrameBitmap in uTransformer.pas.
Removed all inline variables for compatibility below 10.3.
